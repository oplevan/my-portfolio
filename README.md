# Portfolio Website

This is my personal Portfolio website built with React JS and Material UI Components.

## [Demo](https://oplevan.com)

## Description

The idea behind this project was to create a showcase of my technical and design skills using React. I tried to keep the UI as simple as possible yet to make it attractive and stylish. For this project I've used ReactJs, Material UI components and React Router for navigation.
